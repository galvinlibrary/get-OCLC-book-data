Our brain is the most adaptable, modifiable organ in our body, and yet it is the organ we most likely give the least attention. Many individuals who are concerned with having a physically fit body stop their \"workout\" at the neck. In the past five years brain scientists have discovered much more about how the brain works, including that it can be trained to perform better than ever before. You are never too young or too old to adopt healthy brain habits that strengthen the brain's capacity to think smarter. In Make Your Brain Smarter, renowned cognitive neuroscientist Dr. Sandra Bond Chapman introduces you to the very latest research in brain science and shows you how to tailor a program to fit your own needs. In this all-inclusive book, Dr. Chapman delivers a comprehensive \"fitness\" plan that you can use to \"exercise\" your way to a healthier brain. You will find scientifically proven strategies to train deep, insightful, and strategic thinking. You will discover why memory is not the most important measure of brain function, why IQ is an outdated, misleading index of brain potential, and how to become a higher brain performer.","subjects":{"1":["Thought and thinking."],"2":["Cognition."],"3":["Brain."],"4":["Neurosciences."],"5":["Brain."],"6":["Cognition."],"7":["Creativity."],"8":["Neurosciences."],"9":["Thinking."],"10":["Brain.","fast","(OCoLC)fst00837570"],"11":["Cognition.","fast","(OCoLC)fst00866457"],"12":["Neurosciences.","fast","(OCoLC)fst01036509"],"13":["Thought and thinking.","fast","(OCoLC)fst01150249"]}},

But as scientists break open the mind's black box with the latest tools of neuroscience, they're discovering that this is not how the mind works. Our best decisions are a finely tuned blend of both feeling and reason- and the precise mix depends on the situation. When buying a house, for example, it's best to let our unconscience mull over the many variables. But when we are picking a stock, intuition often leads us astray. The trick is to determine when to use the different parts of the brain, and to do this, we need to think harder (and smarter) about how we think. This book offers a fascinating look at the new science of decision-making--and how it can help us make better choices. -- from Book Jacket","subjects":{"1":["Decision Making."],"2":["Decision making."],"3":["Besliskunde.","gtt"],"4":["Besluitvorming.","gtt"],"5":["Entscheidungsverhalten.","swd"],"6":["Kognition.","swd"],"7":["Gefühl.","swd"],"8":["Intuition.","swd"],"9":["Neuropsychologie.","swd"],"10":["Entscheidungstheorie.","idsbb"],"11":["Decision making.","fast","(OCoLC)fst00889035"]}},

And why are the best decisions often those that are impossible to explain to others?

Today's society, Buffett posits, has begun to replace a work ethic, relishing what you do, with a wealth ethic, honoring the payoff instead of the process. Yet, by focusing more on substance and less on reward, we can open doors of opportunity and strive toward a greater sense of fulfillment. Our journey in life rarely follows a straight line but is often met with false starts, crises, and blunders.

  {"isbn":"9781594204111","author":"Silver, Nate,","title":"The signal and the noise: why so many predictions fail--but some don't","summary":"Human beings have to make plans and strategize for the future. As the pace of our lives becomes faster and faster, we have to do so more often and more quickly. But are our predictions any good? Is there hope for improvement? In this book the author examines the world of prediction, investigating how we can distinguish a true signal from a universe of noisy, ever-increasing data. Many predictions fail, often at great cost to society, because most of us have a poor understanding of probability and uncertainty. We are wired to detect a signal, and we mistake more confident predictions for more accurate ones. But overconfidence is often the reason for failure. If our appreciation of uncertainty improves, our predictions can get better too. This is the prediction paradox: the more humility we have about our ability to make predictions, and the more we are willing to learn from our mistakes, the more we can turn information into knowledge and data into foresight. The author examines both successes and failures to determine what more accurate forecasters have in common. In keeping with his own aim to seek truth from data, he visits innovative forecasters in a range of areas, from hurricanes to baseball, from the poker table to the stock market, from Capitol Hill to the NBA. Even when their innovations are modest, we can learn from their methods. How can we train ourselves to think probabilistically, as they do? How can the insights of an eighteenth-century Englishman unlock the twenty-first-century challenges of global warming and terrorism? How can being smarter about the future help us make better decisions in the present?","subjects":{"1":["Forecasting."],"2":["Forecasting","Methodology."],"3":["Forecasting","History."],"4":["Bayesian statistical decision theory."],"5":["Knowledge, Theory of."],"6":["(DE-588)4144220-9","(DE-603)085569240","Bayes-Entscheidungstheorie","gnd"],"7":["(DE-588)4047390-9","(DE-603)085132160","Prognose","gnd"]}},

Every year millions of Americans celebrate St. Patrick's Day, but they may not be aware of how great an influence St. Patrick was on the subsequent history of civilization. Not only did he bring Christianity to Ireland, he instilled a sense of literacy and learning that would create the conditions that allowed Ireland to become \"the isle of saints and scholars\"--And thus preserve Western culture while Europe was being overrun by barbarians. In this entertaining and compelling narrative, Thomas Cahill tells the story of how Europe evolved from the classical age of Rome to the medieval era. Without Ireland, the transition could not have taken place. Not only did Irish monks and scribes maintain the very record of Western civilization -- copying manuscripts of Greek and Latin writers, both pagan and Christian, while libraries and learning on the continent were forever lost -- they brought their uniquely Irish world-view to the task. As Cahill delightfully illustrates, so much of the liveliness we associate with medieval culture has its roots in Ireland. When the seeds of culture were replanted on the European continent, it was from Ireland that they were germinated. In the tradition of Barbara Tuchman's A Distant Mirror, How The Irish Saved Civilization reconstructs an era that few know about but which is central to understanding our past and our cultural heritage. But it conveys its knowledge with a winking wit that aptly captures the sensibility of the unsung Irish who relaunched civilization.","subjects":{"1":["Learning and scholarship","History","Medieval, 500-1500."],"2":["Civilization, Classical","Study and teaching","Ireland."],"3":["Books","History","400-1450."],"4":["Books","Ireland","History","400-1450."],"5":["Manuscripts","Ireland","History."],"6":["Monastic libraries","Ireland."],"7":["Transmission of texts."],"8":["Scriptoria","Ireland."],"9":["Savoir et érudition","Histoire","500-1500 (Moyen Âge)"],"10":["Civilisation ancienne","Étude et enseignement","Irlande."],"11":["Livres","Irlande","Histoire","400-1400."],"12":["Manuscrits","Irlande","Histoire."],"13":["Bibliothèques de monastères","Irlande."],"14":["Transmission de textes."],"15":["Scriptoriums","Irlande."],"16":["Cultuur.","gtt"],"17":["História da europa (civilização)","Irlanda.","larpcal"],"18":["Manuscritos (história)","Irlanda.","larpcal"]}},

She poisoned the second. Ultimately she dispensed with an ambitious sister as well; incest and assassination were family specialties. Cleopatra appears to have had sex with only two men. They happen, however, to have been Julius Caesar and Mark Antony, among the most prominent Romans of the day. Both were married to other women. Cleopatra had a child with Caesar and -- after his murder -- three more with his protégé. Already she was the wealthiest ruler in the Mediterranean; the relationship with Antony confirmed her status as the most influential woman of her age.

He points out the most widespread symptoms, including the belligerence of partisan politics that perverts our democracy, the decline of once common manners, the vulgarity of Hollywood entertainment, the superficiality and untrustworthiness of the news media, the cult of celebrity, and the disappearance of authentic neighborhoods and voluntary organizations (the kind that have actual meetings where one can hobnob instead of just clicking in an online contribution). Meyer argues that when the social, spiritual, and political turmoil that followed the sixties collided with the technological and media revolution at the turn of the century, something inside us hit overload: our culture no longer reflects our own values. As a result, we are now morally and existentially tired, disoriented, anchorless, and defensive.

Asim reveals how nineteenth-century \"science\" then colluded with popular culture to amplify this slander. What began as false generalizations became institutionalized in every corner of our society. Asim argues that even when uttered with the opposite intent by hipsters and hip-hop icons, using the slur helps keep blacks at the bottom of America's socio-economic ladder.

  {"isbn":"0151009996","author":"Cuomo, Mario Matthew","title":"Why Lincoln matters: today more than ever","summary":"Abraham Lincoln became president on the brink of a terrible war, and he led our country through its darkest times. Challenged by slavery, secession, and war, Lincoln was able to articulate forcefully the values and ideals that have sustained our country since its inception. His speeches, writings, and actions melded the Constitution, the Bible, and his own experience into an American scripture that inspires faith in the future. Today, our country faces terrible challenges, a shadowy war, increasing inequality among our people, and a society with knife-sharp divisions-and there is a decided lack of vision in our country's leadership. So Mario Cuomo, former governor of New York, and a gifted political philosopher, returns to Lincoln's words, his speeches and writings, to offer guidance for today's problems. He shows how the big issues--equality, the role of government, war and peace, the responsibilities of the fortunate few--resonate in today's political climate as he brings to life the contemporary relevance of Lincoln's message for today's hot-button subjects. Cuomo's analysis of Abraham Lincoln will inspire readers to believe that government can still be a force for greater good in American society. And it offers us a liberal, generous, and responsible path for the future. Abraham Lincoln is surely the most revered President in our history. His words are American Scripture. And like scripture, Lincoln's words are quoted for good and for ill. Mario Cuomo, three-term Governor of New York, one of the great orators of our day and a staunch liberal, will write the book that shows what a liberal Lincoln was, and how his political philosophy should work as progressive ideas in the 21st century. He takes up all the important subjects for our political era, and shows where Lincoln stood on the issues. The outline includes chapters on: Equality; Freedom; Opportunity; Responsibility; Community; The role of government; The rule of law, and, in light of the recent war in Iraq, he is adding a chapter on \"Just War\" and what that really means. Abraham Lincoln, long the most resonant voice of American political values, was a founding member of the Republican Party. In today's charged political climate, he would be hard-pressed to recognize the issues in the contemporary GOP, argues Mario Cuomo, former governor of New York and a gifted political philosopher. Mario Cuomo shows how the big issues-equality, the role of government, war and peace, the responsibilities of the fortunate few-resonate in today's political climate as he brings to life the contemporary relevance of Lincoln's message for today's hot-button issues. Today's political discourse often lacks depth and wisdom, but Mario Cuomo's analysis of Abraham Lincoln will inspire readers to believe that government can still be a force for greater good in American society.","subjects":{"1":["Außenpolitik.","swd"],"2":["Wirtschaftsentwicklung.","swd"],"3":["Economic history.","fast","(OCoLC)fst00901974"],"4":["Influence (Literary, artistic, etc.)","fast","(OCoLC)fst00972484"],"5":["International relations.","fast","(OCoLC)fst00977053"],"6":["Political and social views.","fast","(OCoLC)fst01353986"],"7":["Political science.","fast","(OCoLC)fst01069781"],"8":["Social history.","fast","(OCoLC)fst01122498"]}},

Historian Goodwin illuminates Lincoln's political genius, as the one-term congressman rises from obscurity to prevail over three gifted rivals to become president. When Lincoln emerged as the victor at the Republican National Convention, his rivals were dismayed. Throughout the turbulent 1850s, each had energetically sought the presidency as the conflict over slavery led inexorably to civil war. That Lincoln succeeded, Goodwin demonstrates, was because of his extraordinary ability to put himself in the place of other men, to experience what they were feeling, to understand their motives and desires. It was this that enabled Lincoln to bring his disgruntled opponents together, create the most unusual cabinet in history, and marshal their talents to the task of preserving the Union.","subjects":{"1":["Political leadership","United States","Case studies."],"2":["Genius","Case studies."],"3":["Presidents","United States","Biography."]}},

The book recounts one of the most dramatic stories in American history, how one gunshot changed the country forever. In the spring of 1865, the bloody saga of America's Civil War finally came to an end after a series of increasingly harrowing battles. President Abraham Lincoln's generous terms for Robert E. Lee's surrender are devised to fulfill Lincoln's dream of healing a divided nation, with the former Confederates allowed to reintegrate into American society. But one man and his band of murderous accomplices, perhaps reaching into the highest ranks of the U.S. government, are not appeased. In the midst of the patriotic celebrations in Washington D.C., John Wilkes Booth, charismatic ladies' man and impenitent racist, murdered Abraham Lincoln at Ford's Theatre. A furious manhunt ensued and Booth immediately became the country's most wanted fugitive. Lafayette C. Baker, a smart but shifty New York detective and former Union spy, unraveled the string of clues leading to Booth, while federal forces tracked his accomplices. The chase ended in a fiery shootout and a series of court-ordered executions, including that of the first woman ever executed by the U.S. government, Mary Surratt.","subjects":{"1":["Assassination.","fast","(OCoLC)fst00818962"]}},

Thanks to human hands, the storied Louisiana coast was eroding, subsiding, and joining the Gulf of Mexico - making it the fastest disappearing landmass on Earth. Yet no one seemed to know how to talk about the problem. Tidwell, a celebrated travel and environmental writer, decided to begin the much-needed conversation, and this vivid, elegiac book is the result. Tidwell introduces us to the surprisingly varied population of the area: the Cajun men and women who work the seasonal shrimp harvest, the Vietnamese fishermen, the Houma Indians driven to the farthest ends of the bayou by the first European settlers. He describes the food, the music, the culture, and the life of all those who live along the bayous. And under his keenly observant eye, the bayou itself becomes a compelling character - reminding us of how much we stand to lose if we fail to address the problems facing this most vibrant of places. - Publisher.","subjects":{"1":["Coast changes","Louisiana","Gulf Coast."],"2":["Bayous","Louisiana","Gulf Region."],"3":["Cajuns","Louisiana","Gulf Coast","Social life and customs."]}},

For centuries, mariners have spun tales of gargantuan waves, 100 feet high or taller. Until recently scientists dismissed these stories; waves that high would seem to violate the laws of physics. But in the past few decades, as a number of ships have vanished and new evidence has emerged, oceanographers realized something was brewing in the planet's waters. They found their proof in February 2000, when a British research vessel was trapped in a vortex of impossibly mammoth waves in the North Sea, including several approaching 100 feet. Scientists scramble to understand this phenomenon. Yet extreme surfers fly around the world trying to ride the ocean's ultimate challenges. The sport's pioneer, Laird Hamilton, with a group of friends in Hawaii, figured out how to board waves of 70 and 80 feet. The exploits of Hamilton and his fellow surfers are juxtaposed against scientists' urgent efforts to understand the destructive powers of waves, from the tsunami that wiped out 250,000 people in the Pacific in 2004 to the 1,740 foot wave that recently leveled part of the Alaskan coast.

For thousands of years the untouchables, or Dalits, the people at the bottom of the Hindu caste system, have been treated as subhuman. Their story has rarely been told. This remarkable book achieves something altogether unprecedented: it gives voice to India's voiceless. In Untouchables, Narendra Jadhav tells the awe-inspiring story of his family's struggle for equality and justice in India. While most Dalits had accepted their lowly position as fate, Jadhav's father rebelled against the oppressive caste system and fought against all odds to forge for his children a destiny that was never ordained. Based on his father's diaries and family stories, Jadhav has written the triumphant story of his parents-their great love, unwavering courage, and eventual victory in the struggle to free themselves and their children from the caste system. Jadhav vividly brings his parents' world to light and unflinchingly documents the life of untouchables-the hunger, the cruel humiliations, the perpetual fear and brutal abuse. Compelling and deeply compassionate, Untouchables is a son's tribute to his parents, an illuminating chronicle of one of the most important moments in Indian history, and an eye-opening work of nonfiction that gives readers access and insight into the lives of India's 165 million Dalits, whose struggle for equality continues even today.","subjects":{"1":["Economists","India","Maharashtra","Biography."],"2":["Monetary reformers","India","Maharashtra","Biography."],"3":["Dalits","India","Maharashtra","Biography."],"4":["Dalits","India","Social conditions","20th century."]}},
  {"isbn":"9780393081817","author":"Lewis, Michael","title":"Boomerang: travels in the new Third World","summary":"As Pogo once said, \"We have met the enemy and he is us.\" In this book the author offers a scathing assessment of fiscal blunders in foreign lands, and details how economic repercussions are sure to be felt on American soil. Financial bubbles grew and burst, not only in the U.S. but in countries as diverse as Iceland, Germany, and Greece. Mixing humor with prescient insight, he depicts a precarious situation that demands attention. The tsunami of cheap credit that rolled across the planet between 2002 and 2008 was more than a simple financial phenomenon: it was temptation, offering entire societies the chance to reveal aspects of their characters they could not normally afford to indulge. Icelanders wanted to stop fishing and become investment bankers. The Greeks wanted to turn their country into a piñata stuffed with cash and allow as many citizens as possible to take a whack at it. The Germans wanted to be even more German; the Irish wanted to stop being Irish. This investigation of bubbles beyond our shores is so sadly hilarious that it leads the American reader to a comfortable complacency: oh, those foolish foreigners. But when he turns a merciless eye on California and Washington, D.C., we see that the narrative is a trap baited with humor, and we understand the reckoning that awaits the greatest and greediest of debtor nations. - Publisher.","subjects":{"1":["Global Financial Crisis, 2008-2009."],"2":["International finance."],"3":["Financial crises","United States","History","21st century."],"4":["Erlebnisbericht.","(DE-588c)4133254-4","swd"],"5":["Finanzkrise.","(DE-588c)7635855-0","swd"],"6":["Kreditmarkt.","(DE-588c)4073788-3","swd"],"7":["Spekulative Blase.","(DE-588c)4450213-8","swd"],"8":["Staatsbankrott.","(DE-588c)4056637-7","swd"],"9":["Öffentliche Schulden.","(DE-588c)4043153-8","swd"],"10":["International economic relations.","sears"],"11":["Financial crises","United States","History.","sears"],"12":["Crise économique (2008).","ram"],"13":["Prêts hypothécaires à risque.","ram"]}},

This book retells the story of Milton Friedman's free-market economic revolution. In contrast to the myth of this movement's peaceful global victory, Klein shows how it has exploited moments of shock and extreme violence in order to implement its economic policies. At its core is the use of cataclysmic events to advance radical privatization combined with the privatization of the disaster response itself. Klein argues that by capitalizing on crises, created by nature or war, the disaster capitalism complex now exists as a booming new economy, the violent culmination of a radical economic project that has been incubating for fifty years.--From publisher description.","subjects":{"1":["Free enterprise."],"2":["Financial crises."],"3":["Capitalism."],"4":["Rampen.","gtt"],"5":["Oorlogen.","gtt"],"6":["Internationalisatie.","gtt"],"7":["Kapitalisme.","gtt"],"8":["Overheidsbeleid.","gtt"],"9":["Free enterprise.","sears"],"10":["Financial crises.","sears"],"11":["Capitalism.","sears"],"12":["Capitalism.","fast","(OCoLC)fst00846425"],"13":["Financial crises.","fast","(OCoLC)fst00924607"],"14":["Free enterprise.","fast","(OCoLC)fst00933866"]}},

His passions and curiosity have transformed the way we live. In 2007 and again in 2008, Time named him one of the hundred most influential people in the world.  It all started on a snowy day in December 1974, when he was twenty-one years old. After buying the new issue of Popular Electronics in Harvard Square, Allen ran to show it to his best friend from Seattle, Bill Gates, then a Harvard undergrad. The magazine's cover story featured the Altair 8800, the first true personal computer; Allen knew that he and Gates had the skills to code a programming language for it. When Gates agreed to collaborate on BASIC for the Altair, one of the most influential partnerships of the digital era was up and running.  While much has been written about Microsoft's early years, Allen has never before told the story from his point of view. Nor has he previously talked about the details of his complex relationship with Gates or his behind-closed- doors perspective on how a struggling startup became the most powerful technology company in the world.

This means that women's voices are still not heard equally in the decisions that most affect our lives. In this book the author examines why women's progress in achieving leadership roles has stalled, explains the root causes, and offers solutions that can empower women to achieve their full potential. She is the chief operating officer of Facebook and is ranked on Fortune magazine's list of the 50 Most Powerful Women in Business and as one of Time magazine's 100 Most Influential People in the World. In 2010, she gave an electrifying TEDTalk in which she described how women unintentionally hold themselves back in their careers. Her talk, which became a phenomenon and has been viewed more than two million times, encouraged women to \"sit at the table,\" seek challenges, take risks, and pursue their goals with gusto. She digs deeper into these issues, combining personal anecdotes, hard data, and compelling research to cut through the layers of ambiguity and bias surrounding the lives and choices of working women. She recounts her own decisions, mistakes, and daily struggles to make the right choices for herself, her career, and her family. She provides advice on negotiation techniques, mentorship, and building a satisfying career, urging women to set boundaries and to abandon the myth of \"having it all.\" She describes specific steps women can take to combine professional achievement with personal fulfillment and demonstrates how men can benefit by supporting women in the workplace and at home. The book is a call to action and a blueprint for individual growth; it is designed to change the conversation from what women can't do to what they can.","subjects":{"1":["Women executives."],"2":["Leadership in women."]}},

He attends ship-handling school on a pond in the foothills of the French Alps, where, for a tuition of $15,000 a week, skippers of the largest ocean ships refine their capabilities in twenty-foot scale models. He goes up the Illinois River on a \"towboat\" pushing a triple string of barges, the overall vessel being \"a good deal longer than the Titanic.\" And he travels by canoe up the canal-and-lock commercial waterways traveled by Henry David Thoreau and his brother, John, in a homemade skiff in 1839.--From publisher description.","subjects":{"1":["Freight and freightage."],"2":["Transportation."],"3":["Freight and freightage.","idszbzna"],"4":["Transportation.","idszbzna"],"5":["Freight and freightage.","fast","(OCoLC)fst00934154"],"6":["Transportation.","fast","(OCoLC)fst01155007"]}},

Eduardo Saverin and Mark Zuckerberg were Harvard undergraduates and best friends, outsiders at a school filled with polished prep-school grads and longtime legacies. They shared both academic brilliance in math and a geeky awkwardness with the opposite sex. The two figured their ticket to social acceptance, and sexual success, was getting invited to join one of Harvard's elite final clubs. But on their road to getting punched into the famous Phoenix Club, they found an even more valuable ticket to social stardom. One lonely night Mark Zuckerberg hacked into the university's computer system, creating a ratable database of all the female students on campus, subsequently crashing the university's servers, and nearly getting himself kicked out of school. In that moment, in his spartan Harvard dorm room, the barebones framework for Facebook was born. What followed, a real-life adventure filled with unimaginable wealth, sex, exotic locales, six-foot-five identical-twin Olympic rowers, and betrayal, makes for one of the most entertaining and compelling books of the year. The great irony is that Facebook succeeded by bringing people together, while at the same time, it tore two best friends apart.","subjects":{"1":["Webmasters","United States","Biography."],"2":["College students","United States","Biography."],"3":["Businesspeople","United States","Biography."],"4":["Online social networks."],"5":["Websites.","gtt"],"6":["Sociale netwerken.","gtt"],"7":["Facebook","swd"],"8":["Computer Programers."]}},

To Christians, love of it is the root of all evil. To generals, it's the sinews of war. To revolutionaries, it's the chains of labor. But historian Ferguson shows that finance is in fact the foundation of human progress. What's more, he reveals financial history as the essential backstory behind all history. Through Ferguson's expert lens, for example, the civilization of the Renaissance looks very different: a boom in the market for art and architecture made possible when Italian bankers adopted Arabic mathematics. The rise of the Dutch republic is reinterpreted as the triumph of the world's first modern bond market over insolvent Habsburg absolutism. Yet the central lesson of financial history is that, sooner or later, every bubble bursts.--From publisher description.","subjects":{"1":["Finance","History."],"2":["Economic history."],"3":["Economics","History."],"4":["Money","History."],"5":["International finance","History."],"6":["Geld.","gtt"],"7":["Financiële structuur.","gtt"],"8":["Financiële ontwikkeling.","gtt"],"9":["Finances","Histoire."],"10":["Histoire économique."],"11":["Économie politique","Histoire."],"12":["Monnaie","Histoire."],"13":["Finances internationales","Histoire."],"14":["Kreditmarkt.","swd"],"15":["Geld.","swd"]}},

  {"isbn":"9781592405503","author":"Gorant, Jim","title":"The lost dogs: Michael Vick's dogs and their tale of rescue and redemption","summary":"This book tells the story of survival and our powerful bond with man's best friend, in the aftermath of the nation's most notorious case of animal cruelty. Animal lovers and sports fans were shocked when the story broke about NFL player Michael Vick's brutal dog fighting operation. But what became of the dozens of dogs who survived? As the author discovered, their story is the truly newsworthy aspect of this case. Expanding on his Sports Illustrated cover story, this book traces the effort to bring Vick to justice and turns the spotlight on these infamous pit bulls, which were saved from euthanasia by an outpouring of public appeals coupled with a court order that Vick pay nearly a million dollars in \"restitution\" to the dogs.  As an ASPCA led team evaluated each one, they found a few hardened fighters, but many more lovable, friendly creatures desperate for compassion. In this book, we meet these amazing animals, a number of which are now living in loving homes, while some even work in therapy programs: Johnny Justice participates in Paws for Tales, which lets kids get comfortable with reading aloud by reading to dogs; Leo spends three hours a week with cancer patients and troubled teens. At the heart of the stories are the rescue workers who transformed the pups from victims of animal cruelty into healing caregivers themselves.","subjects":{"1":["Dog rescue","Virginia","Smithfield","Anecdotes."],"2":["Animal welfare","United States."],"3":["Pit bull terriers","Virginia","Smithfield","Anecdotes."]}},

When Katrina hit, Clark, a key correspondent for National Public Radio during the storm, immediately began to record hundreds of hours of conversations with its victims, not only in the city but throughout the Gulf: the devastated poor and rich alike; rescue workers from around the country; reporters; local characters who could exist nowhere else but New Orleans; politicians; the woman Clark loved, in a relationship ravaged by the storm.

In an eye-opening account, Daniel Domscheit-Berg, the former spokesman of WikiLeaks, reveals never-disclosed details about the inner workings of the increasingly controversial organization that has struck fear into governments and business organizations worldwide and prompted the Pentagon to convene a 120-man task force.  In addition to Germany and the U.S., Inside WikiLeaks will be published simultaneously in 12 other countries.  Under the pseudonym Daniel Schmitt, Domscheit-Berg was the effective No. 2 at WikiLeaks and the organization's most public face, after Julian Assange.  In this book, he reveals the evolution, finances, and inner tensions of the whistleblower organization, beginning with his first meeting with Assange in December 2007.  He also describes what led to his September 2010 withdrawal from WikiLeaks, including his disenchantment with the organization's lack of transparency, its abandonment of political neutrality, and Assange's increasing concentration of power.  What has been made public so far about WikiLeaks is only a small fraction of the truth.  With Domscheit-Berg's insider knowledge, he is uniquely able to tell the full story.  A computer scientist who worked in IT security prior to devoting himself full-time to WikiLeaks, he remains committed to freedom of information on the Internet.

It can persuade us to buy something, or remind us of our first date. It can lift us out of depression when nothing else can. It can get us dancing to its beat. But the power of music goes much, much further. Indeed, music occupies more areas of our brain than language does--humans are a musical species.

This book is the fruit of over 30 years of research and hundreds of exclusive interviews with a remarkable level of access to the very closest circles of the Jackson family-including Michael himself.  Cutting through tabloid rumors, J. Randy Taraborrelli traces the real story behind Michael Jackson, from his drilling as a child star through the blooming of his talent to his ever-changing personal appearance and bizarre publicity stunts.  This major biography includes the behind-the-scenes story to many of the landmarks in Jackson's life: his legal and commercial battles, his marriages to Lisa Marie Presley and Debbie Rowe, his passions and addictions, his children.

In response to the scandal of his open affair with proto-feminist and free love advocate Mamah Borthwick Cheney (both were married at the time), Wright built Taliesin as a \"love cottage\" for himself and his mistress. The original Taliesin would stand in all its isolated glory for only a few months before the bloody slayings that rocked the nation and reduced the structure itself to a smoking hull.

With graphic narrative that \"was closer to the writing of Bernard Malamud or Isaac Bashevis Singer than any comic art which had preceded it\" (The Economist), A Contract with God, originally published in 1978, was the first graphic novel: the prototype-along with A Life Force and Dropsie Avenue-for such seminal works as Maus and Persepolis. Set during the Great Depression, this literary trilogy, assembled in one volume for the first time, presents a treasure house of now near-mythic stories that fictionally illustrate the bittersweet tenement life of Eisner's youth. With nearly one dozen new illustrations and a revealing brand-new foreword, this book ultimately tells the epic story of life, death, and resurrection while exploring man's fractious relationship with an all-too-vengeful God. This mesmerizing, fictional chronicle of the universal American immigrant experience is Eisner's most poignant and enduring legacy.","subjects":{"1":["Immigrants","New York (State)","New York","Comic books, strips, etc."],"2":["Tenement houses","New York (State)","New York","Comic books, strips, etc."]}},

One day David Small awoke from a supposedly harmless operation to discover that he had been transformed into a virtual mute. A vocal cord removed, his throat slashed and stitched together like a bloody boot, the fourteen-year-old boy had not been told that he had cancer and was expected to die. In Stitches, Small, the award-winning children's illustrator and author, re-creates this terrifying event in a life story that might have been imagined by Kafka. As the images painfully tumble out, one by one, we gain a ringside seat at a gothic family drama where David, a highly anxious yet supremely talented child, all too often became the unwitting object of his parents' buried frustration and rage. Believing that they were trying to do their best, David's parents did just the reverse. Edward Small, a Detroit physician who vented his own anger by hitting a punching bag, was convinced that he could cure his young son's respiratory problems with heavy doses of radiation, possibly causing David's cancer. Elizabeth, David's mother, tyrannically stingy and excessively scolding, ran the Small household under a cone of silence where emotions, especially her own, were hidden. Depicting this coming-of-age story with dazzling, kaleidoscopic images that turn nightmare into fairy tale, Small tells us of his journey from sickly child to cancer patient, to the troubled teen whose risky decision to run away from home at sixteen, with nothing more than the dream of becoming an artist, will resonate as the ultimate survival statement. A silent movie masquerading as a book, Stitches renders a broken world suddenly seamless and beautiful again.","subjects":{"1":["Authors, American","20th century","Biography","Comic books, strips, etc."],"2":["Artists","United States","Biography","Comic books, strips, etc."],"3":["Children's stories","Illustrations","Comic books, strips, etc."],"4":["Children's stories","Authorship","Comic books, strips, etc."],"5":["Autobiographical comic books, strips, etc."]}},

The Intersolar Commonwealth, a sphere of stars some four hundred light-years in diameter, contains more than six hundred worlds, interconnected by a web of transport \"tunnels\" known as wormholes. At the farthest edge of the Commonwealth, astronomer Dudley Bose observes the impossible: Over one thousand light-years away, a star ... vanishes. It does not go supernova. It does not collapse into a black hole. It simply disappears. Since the location is too distant to reach by wormhole, a faster-than-light starship, the Second Chance, is dispatched to learn what has occurred and whether it represents a threat. In command is Wilson Kime, a five-time rejuvenated ex-NASA pilot whose glory days are centuries behind him. Opposed to the mission are the Guardians of Selfhood, a cult that believes the human race is being manipulated by an alien entity they call the Starflyer. Bradley Johansson, leader of the Guardians, warns of sabotage, fearing the Starflyer means to use the starship--s mission for its own ends. Pursued by a Commonwealth special agent convinced the Guardians are crazy but dangerous, Johansson flees. But the danger is not averted. Aboard the Second Chance, Kime wonders if his crew has been infiltrated. Soon enough, he will have other worries. A thousand light-years away, something truly incredible is waiting: a deadly discovery whose unleashing will threaten to destroy the Commonwealth ... and humanity itself.

  {"isbn":"0385503954","author":"McEwan, Ian","title":"Atonement: a novel","summary":"On the hottest day of the summer of 1935, thirteen-year-old Briony Tallis sees her sister, Cecilia, strip off her clothes and plunge into the fountain in the garden of their country house. Watching her is Robbie Turner, her childhood friend who, like Cecilia, has recently come down from Cambridge. By the end of that day, the lives of all three will have been changed forever. Robbie and Cecilia will have crossed a boundary they had not even imagined at its start, and will have become victims of the younger girl's imagination. Briony will have witnessed mysteries and committed a crime that creates in her a sense of guilt that will color her entire life. Ian McEwan has in each of his novels drawn the reader brilliantly into the intimate lives and situations of his characters. But never before has he written on a canvas so large: taking the reader from a manor house in England in 1935, to the retreat to Dunkirk in 1941, to a London hospital soon after where the maimed, broken, and dying soldiers are shipped from the evacuation, to a reunion of the Tallis clan in 1999. Atonement is Ian McEwan's finest achievement. Brilliant and utterly enthralling in its depiction of childhood, love and war. England and class, it is at its center a profound-and profoundly moving-exploration of shame and forgiveness, of atonement and the difficulty of absolution.","subjects":{"1":["Teenage girls","Fiction."],"2":["Country life","Fiction."],"3":["Ex-convicts","Fiction."],"4":["Sisters","Fiction."],"5":["Guilt","Fiction."],"6":["Domestic fiction."],"7":["Psychological fiction."]}},

Miriam Beckstein is happy in her life. She's a successful reporter for a hi-tech magazine in Boston, making good money doing what she loves. When her researcher brings her iron-clad evidence of a money-laundering scheme, Miriam thinks she's found the story of the year. But when she takes it to her editor, she's fired on the spot and gets a death threat from the criminals she has uncovered. Before the day is over, she's received a locket left by the mother she never knew-the mother who was murdered when she was an infant. Within is a knotwork pattern, which has a hypnotic effect on her. Before she knows it, she's transported herself to a parallel Earth, a world where knights on horseback chase their prey with automatic weapons, and where world-skipping assassins lurk just on the other side of reality - a world where her true family runs things. The six families of the Clan rule the kingdom of Gruinmarkt from behind the scenes, a mixture of nobility and criminal conspirators whose power to walk between the worlds makes them rich in both. Braids of family loyalty and intermarriage provide a fragile guarantee of peace, but a recently-ended civil war has left the families shaken and suspicious. Taken in by her mother's people, she becomes the star of the story of the century-as Cinderella without a fairy godmother. As her mother's heir, Miriam is hailed as the prodigal countess Helge Thorold-Hjorth, and feted and feasted. Caught up in schemes and plots centuries in the making, Miriam is surrounded by unlikely allies, forbidden loves, lethal contraband, and, most dangerous of all, her family. Her unexpected return will supercede the claims of other clan members to her mother's fortune and power, and whoever killed her mother will be happy to see her dead, too. Behind all this lie deeper secrets still, which threaten everyone and everything she has ever known. Patterns of deception and interlocking lies, as intricate as the knotwork between the universes. But Miriam is no one's pawn, and is determined to conquer her new home on her own terms. Blending the creativity and humor of Roger Zelazny, the adventure of H. Beam Piper and Philip Jose Farmer, and the rigor and scope of a science-fiction writer on the grandest scale, Charles Stross has set a new standard for fantasy epics.","subjects":{"1":["Murder victims' families","Fiction."],"2":["Inheritance and succession","Fiction."],"3":["Women journalists","Fiction."],"4":["Fantasy.","gsafd"]}},

Months after the Waterless Flood pandemic has wiped out most of humanity, Toby and Ren have rescued their friend Amanda from the vicious Painballers. They return to the MaddAddamite cob house, which is being fortified against man and giant Pigoon alike. Accompanying them are the Crakers, the gentle, quasihuman species engineered by the brilliant but deceased Crake. While their reluctant prophet, Jimmy--Crake's one-time friend--recovers from a debilitating fever, it's left to Toby to narrate the Craker theology, with Crake as Creator. She must also deal with cultural misunderstandings, terrible coffee, and her jealousy over her lover, Zeb. Meanwhile, Zeb searches for Adam One, founder of the God's Gardeners, the pacifist green religion from which Zeb broke years ago to lead the MaddAddamites in active resistance against the destructive CorpSeCorps. Now, under threat of an imminent Painballer attack, the MaddAddamites must fight back with the aid of their newfound allies, some of whom have four trotters. At the center is the extraordinary story of Zeb's past, which involves a lost brother, a hidden murder, a bear, and a bizarre act of revenge.

  {"isbn":"9780385528771","author":"Atwood, Margaret,","title":"The year of the flood: a novel","summary":"From the Publisher:  The times and species have been changing at a rapid rate, and the social compact is wearing as thin as environmental stability. Adam One, the kindly leader of the God's Gardeners-a religion devoted to the melding of science and religion, as well as the preservation of all plant and animal life-has long predicted a natural disaster that will alter Earth as we know it. Now it has occurred, obliterating most human life. Two women have survived:  Ren, a young trapeze dancer locked inside the high-end sex club Scales and Tails, and Toby, a God's Gardener barricaded inside a luxurious spa where many of the treatments are edible. Have others survived? Ren's bioartist friend Amanda? Zeb, her eco-fighter stepfather? Her onetime lover, Jimmy? Or the murderous Painballers, survivors of the mutual-elimination Painball prison? Not to mention the shadowy, corrupt policing force of the ruling powers. Meanwhile, gene-spliced life forms are proliferating:  the lion/lamb blends, the Mo'hair sheep with human hair, the pigs with human brain tissue. As Adam One and his intrepid hemp-clad band make their way through this strange new world, Ren and Toby will have to decide on their next move, but they can't stay locked away. By turns dark, tender, violent, thoughtful, and uneasily hilarious, The Year of the Flood is Atwood at her most brilliant and inventive.","subjects":{"1":["Environmental disasters","Fiction."],"2":["Regression (Civilization)","Fiction."],"3":["Science fiction.","gsafd"],"4":["Globalisierung","swd"],"5":["Zukunft","swd"]}},
  {"isbn":"9780385533966","author":"Atwood, Margaret,","title":"In other worlds: SF and the human imagination","summary":"At a time when speculative fiction seems less and less far-fetched, Margaret Atwood lends her distinctive voice and singular point of view to the genre in a series of essays that brilliantly illuminates the essential truths about the modern world. This is an exploration of her relationship with the literary form we have come to know as \"science fiction,\" a relationship that has been lifelong, stretching from her days as a child reader in the 1940s, through her time as a graduate student at Harvard, where she worked on the Victorian ancestor of the form, and continuing as a writer and reviewer. This book brings together her three heretofore unpublished Ellmann Lectures from 2010: \"Flying Rabbits,\" which begins with Atwood's early rabbit superhero creations and goes on to speculate about masks, capes, weakling alter egos, and Things with Wings; \"Burning Bushes,\" which follows her into Victorian otherlands and beyond; and \"Dire Cartographies,\" which investigates Utopias and Dystopias. In Other Worlds also includes some of Atwood's key reviews and thoughts about the form. Among those writers discussed are Marge Piercy, Rider Haggard, Ursula Le Guin, Ishiguro, Bryher, Huxley, and Jonathan Swift. She elucidates the differences (as she sees them) between \"science fiction\" proper and \"speculative fiction,\" as well as between \"sword and sorcery/fantasy\" and \"slipstream fiction.\" For all readers who have loved The Handmaid's Tale, Oryx and Crake, and The Year of the Flood, In Other Worlds is a must.","subjects":{"1":["Science fiction","History and criticism."],"2":["Science fiction","Authorship."],"3":["Science fiction","History and criticism.","sears"],"4":["Science fiction","Technique.","sears"]}},

And climb it the Prendergasts begin to do when Audrey launches a children's show called Rumpus Room, starring herself as Miss Mary and her young son Henry as Bee Good/Bee Bad. When the program becomes an overnight sensation, the Prendergasts' world begins to change, much to the chagrin of Audrey's husband, Peter, family comedian and would-be novelist. Determined to keep his family anchored in reality, Peter refuses to have anything to do with Rumpus Room and throws all his energy into writing his novel and doing an almost non-stop and hilarious commentary on modern culture. When Audrey's second television series becomes a huge success, things begin to break down. The show becomes a kind of camp classic, attracting a group of fanatic followers who call themselves 'Philosophers' and more or less worship the teenage Henry.

Written earlier in Martel's career, these tales are as moving as they are thought-provoking, as inventive in form as they are timeless in content.

A dead bird is found on the doorstep, a postage stamp bizarrely pinned to its beak. Hours later, Flavia finds a man lying in the cucumber patch and watches him as he takes his dying breath. For Flavia, who is both appalled and delighted, life begins in earnest when murder comes to Buckshaw. 'I wish I could say I was afraid, but I wasn't. Quite the contrary. This was by far the most interesting thing that had ever happened to me in my entire life.' To Flavia the investigation is the stuff of science: full of possibilities, contradictions, and connections. Soon her father, a man raising his three daughters alone, is seized, accused of murder. And in a police cell, during a violent thunderstorm, Colonel de Luce tells his daughter an astounding story - of a schoolboy friendship turned ugly, of a priceless object that vanished in a bizarre and brazen act of thievery, of a Latin teacher who flung himself to his death from the school's tower thirty years before. Now Flavia is armed with more than enough knowledge to tie two distant deaths together, to examine new suspects, and begin a search that will lead her all the way to the King of England himself. Of this much the girl is sure: her father is innocent of murder - but protecting her and her sisters from something even worse.\"--Publisher's description.","subjects":{"1":["Detectives","England","Fiction."],"2":["Motherless families","Fiction."],"3":["Sisters","Fiction."]}},

The narrator of the story is Bethia Mayfield, growing up in the tiny settlement of Great Harbor amid a small band of pioneers and Puritans. Restless and curious, she yearns after an education that is closed to her by her sex. As often as she can, she slips away to explore the island's glistening beaches and observe its native Wampanoag inhabitants. At twelve, she encounters Caleb, the young son of a chieftain, and the two forge a tentative secret friendship that draws each into the alien world of the other. Bethia's minister father tries to convert the Wampanoag, awakening the wrath of the tribe's shaman, against whose magic he must test his own beliefs. One of his projects becomes the education of Caleb, and a year later, Caleb is in Cambridge, studying Latin and Greek among the colonial elite.

Drawing on his own interviews with Lem as well as analysis of his works, Swirski considers the author's scenarios involving computers capable of creative acts and discusses their socio-cultural implications.

You will never know how much enjoyment you have lost until you get to dictating your autobiography.\" Thus, after dozens of false starts and hundreds of pages, Twain embarked on his \"Final (and Right) Plan\" for telling the story of his life. His innovative notion -- to \"talk only about the thing which interests you for the moment\"--Meant that his thoughts could range freely. The strict instruction that many of these texts remain unpublished for 100 years meant that when they came out, he would be \"dead, and unaware, and indifferent,\" and that he was therefore free to speak his \"whole frank mind.\" The year 2010 marks the 100th anniversary of Twain's death. In celebration of this important milestone and in honor of the cherished tradition of publishing Mark Twain's works, UC Press is proud to offer for the first time Mark Twain's uncensored autobiography in its entirety and exactly as he left it. This major literary event brings to readers, admirers, and scholars the first of three volumes and presents Mark Twain's authentic and unsuppressed voice, brimming with humor, ideas, and opinions, and speaking clearly from the grave as he intended. - Publisher.","subjects":{"1":["Authors, American","19th century","Biography."],"2":["American authors","Biography.","sears"]}},

Habegger discovers the best available answers to the pressing questions about the poet: Was she lesbian? Who was the person she evidently loved? Why did she refuse to publish, and why was this refusal so integral an aspect of her work? Habegger also illuminates many of the essential connections in Dickinson's story: between the decay of doctrinal Protestantism and the emergence of her riddling lyric vision; between her father's political isolation after the Whig Party's collapse and her private poetic vocation; between her frustrated quest for human intimacy and the tuning of her uniquely seductive voice.\"--Jacket.","subjects":{"1":["Poets, American","19th century","Biography."],"2":["Women and literature","United States","History","19th century."],"3":["Poètes américains","19e siècle","Biographies."],"4":["Femmes et littérature","États-Unis","Histoire","19e siècle."]}},

Ray Bradbury is, indisputably, one of America's greatest storytellers. The recipient of the 2000 National Book Foundation Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters, he ranks among the most beloved, and widely read, of American authors. In The Cat's Pajamas, this \"latter-day O. Henry\" (Booklist) takes us on an amazing walk through his six-decade career, presenting twenty-two tales, some old, some new, all but two never before published. Here you will find stories strange and scary, nostalgic and bittersweet, humorous and heart-touching, ranging from the not-so-long-gone past to an unknowable future: a group of senators drinks a bit too much, and gambles away the United States; a newlywed couple buys an old house and finds their fledgling relationship tested; two mysterious strangers arrive at a rooming house and baffle their fellow occupants with strange crying in the night; a lonely woman takes a last chance on love. The final piece in the collection is a story-poem, a fond salute from Bradbury to his literary heroes Shaw, Chesterton, Dickens, Twain, Poe, Wilde, Melville, and Kipling. The Cat's Pajamas is just that, the bee's knees, a touching, timeless, and tender collection from the incomparable Ray Bradbury, and a panoramic view of an amazingly long, rich, and fertile creative career.","subjects":{"1":["Short stories."],"2":["Short stories.","fast","(OCoLC)fst01117043"]}},

  {"isbn":"0618084746","author":"McCullers, Carson,","title":"The heart is a lonely hunter","summary":"With the publication of her first novel, The Heart is a Lonely Hunter, Carson McCullers, all of twenty-three, became a literary sensation. With its profound sense of moral isolation and its compassionate glimpses into its characters' inner lives, the novel is considered McCullers' finest work, an enduring masterpiece first published by Houghton Mifflin in 1940. At its center is the deaf-mute John Singer, who becomes the confidant for various types of misfits in a Georgia mill town during the 1930s. Each one yearns for escape from small town life. When Singer's mute companion goes insane, Singer moves into the Kelly house, where Mick Kelly, the book's heroine (and loosely based on McCullers), finds solace in her music. Wonderfully attuned to the spiritual isolation that underlies the human condition, and with a deft sense for racial tensions in the South, McCullers spins a haunting, unforgettable story that gives voice to the rejected, the forgotten, and the mistreated -- and, through Mick Kelly, gives voice to the quiet, intensely personal search for beauty. Richard Wright praised Carson McCullers for her ability \"to rise above the pressures of her environment and embrace white and black humanity in one sweep of apprehension and tenderness.\" She writes \"with a sweep and certainty that are overwhelming,\" said the New York Times. McCullers became an overnight literary sensation, but her novel has endured, just as timely and powerful today as when it was first published. The Heart is a Lonely Hunter is Carson McCullers at her most compassionate, endearing best.","subjects":{"1":["Teenage girls","Fiction."],"2":["Suicide victims","Fiction."],"3":["Friendship","Fiction."],"4":["Racism","Fiction."],"5":["Deaf","Fiction."],"6":["Psychological fiction."],"7":["Bildungsromans.","gsafd"]}},

White's eccentric life in nature and the birth of an American classic","summary":"As he was composing what was to become his most enduring and popular book, E. B. White was obeying that oft repeated maxim: \"Write what you know.\" Helpless pigs, silly geese, clever spiders, greedy rats, White knew all of these characters in the barns and stables where he spent his favorite hours. Painfully shy his entire life, \"this boy,\" White once wrote of himself, \"felt for animals a kinship he never felt for people.\" It is all the more impressive, therefore, how many people have felt a kinship with E. B. White. With Charlotte's Web, which has gone on to sell more than 45 million copies, the man William Shawn called \"the most companionable of writers\" lodged his own character, the avuncular author, into the hearts of generations of readers.  In this book the author shows how White solved what critic Clifton Fadiman once called \"the standing problem of the juvenile fantasy writer: how to find, not another Alice, but another rabbit hole\" by mining the raw ore of his childhood friendship with animals in Mount Vernon, New York, translating his own passions and contradictions, delights and fears, into an all time classic. Blending White's correspondence with the likes of Ursula Nordstrom, James Thurber, and Harold Ross, the E. B. White papers at Cornell, and the archives of HarperCollins and the New Yorker into his own narrative, the author brings to life the shy boy whose animal stories, real and imaginery, made him famous around the world.","subjects":{"1":["Authors, American","20th century","Biography."],"2":["Children's stories","Authorship."],"3":["American authors","Biography.","sears"]}},

Could it be that the sheriff is so taken in by this creature who reminds him of his deceased wife that he would ignore the possibility that she is just as dangerous as the men she harbors? The danger in the desert increases tenfold with the return of serial murderer Preacher Jack Collins, whom The New York Times called \"one of Burke's most inspired villains.\" Presumed dead at the close of Rain Gods, Preacher Jack has reemerged with a calm, single-minded zeal for killing that is more terrifying than the muzzle flash of his signature machine gun. But this time he and Sheriff Holland have a common enemy. Praised by Joyce Carol Oates for \"the luminosity of his writerly voice,\" James Lee Burke returns with his most allegorical novel to date, illuminating vital issues of our time- -immigration, energy, religious freedom- with the rich atmosphere and devastatingly flawed, authentic characters that readers have come to celebrate during the five decades of his brilliant career. -- Book Jacket","subjects":{"1":["Sheriffs","Texas","Fiction."],"2":["Human trafficking","Fiction."],"3":["Missing persons","Fiction."]}},

The middle child, Chip, has lost his seemingly secure academic job and is failing spectacularly at his new line of work. And Denise, the youngest, has escaped a disastrous marriage only to pour her youth and heart down the drain of an affair with a married man - or so her mother fears. Desperate for some pleasure to look forward to, Enid has set her heart on an elusive goal: bringing her family together for one last Christmas at home.\"--Jacket.","subjects":{"1":["Married women","Fiction."],"2":["Parkinson's disease","Patients","Fiction."],"3":["Parent and adult child","Fiction."],"4":["Domestic fiction."],"5":["Domestic fiction.","lcsh"]}},

The Wheel of Time turns, and Robert Jordan gives us the eleventh volume of his extraordinary masterwork of fantasy. The dead are walking, men die impossible deaths, and it seems as though reality itself has become unstable: All are signs of the imminence of Tarmon Gai'don, the Last Battle, when Rand al'Thor, the Dragon Reborn, must confront the Dark One as humanity's only hope. But Rand dares not fight until he possesses all the surviving seals on the Dark One's prison and has dealt with the Seanchan, who threaten to overrun all nations this side of the Aryth Ocean and increasingly seem too entrenched to be fought off. But his attempt to make a truce with the Seanchan is shadowed by treachery that may cost him everything. Whatever the price, though, he must have that truce. And he faces other dangers. There are those among the Forsaken who will go to any length to see him dead and the Black Ajah is at his side. Unbeknownst to Rand, Perrin has made his own truce with the Seanchan. It is a deal made with the Dark One, in his eyes, but he will do whatever is needed to rescue his wife, Faile, and destroy the Shaido who captured her. Among the Shaido, Faile works to free herself while hiding a secret that might give her her freedom or cause her destruction. And at a town called Malden, the Two Rivers longbow will be matched against Shaido spears. Fleeing Ebou Dar through Seanchan-controlled Altara with the kidnapped Daughter of the Nine Moons, Mat attempts to court the woman to whom he is half-married, knowing that she will complete that ceremony eventually.

And just when you think he has taken his spellbinding tales of mystery and psychological suspense to the limit, with Deception he takes a bold leap into terrifying and uncharted new territory. Her name is Elise Freeman, and her chilling cry for help - to whoever may be listening - comes too late to save her. On a DVD found near her lifeless body, the emotionally and physically battered woman chronicles a year-and-a-half-long ordeal of monstrous abuse at the hands of three sadistic tormentors. But even more shocking than the lurid details is the revelation that the offenders, like their victim, are teachers at one of L.A.'s most prestigious prep schools. With Elise now dead by uncertain means, homicide detective Milo Sturgis is assigned to probe the hallowed halls of Windsor Prep Academy. And if ever he could use Dr. Alex Delaware's psychological prowess, it's now. From the get-go, this case promises to be an uphill climb for truth and a down and dirty fight for justice. Allegations of rape, assault, and possibly murder at this esteemed institution renowned for molding Ivy Leaguers make for a social and political time bomb - especially given that one of the students has connections high up in City Hall. As the scandal-conscious elite of L.A. close ranks around Windsor Prep, Alex and Milo must penetrate the citadel of wealth and scholarship to expose the hidden anguish, dirty secrets, and deadly sins festering among society's manor-born. But power and position are not easily surrendered, for that's when the best and the brightest turn brutal and ugly. Searching for predators among the privileged, Alex and Milo may well be walking into a highly polished death trap.\"--Jacket.","subjects":{"1":["Delaware, Alex (Fictitious character)","Fiction."],"2":["Sturgis, Milo (Fictitious character)","Fiction."],"3":["Psychologists","Fiction."],"4":["Police","California","Los Angeles","Fiction."],"5":["Sexual abuse victims","Fiction."],"6":["Women teachers","Crimes against","Fiction."],"7":["Preparatory schools","Fiction."],"8":["Preparatory schools-Fiction."],"9":["Women teachers-Crimes against-Fiction."]}},

The state police of Troop D in rural Pennsylvania have kept a secret in Shed B out back of the barracks ever since 1979, when Troopers Ennis Rafferty and Curtis Wilcox answered a call from a gas station just down the road and came back with an abandoned Buick Roadmaster. Curt Wilcox knew old cars, and he knew immediately that this one was ... wrong, just wrong. A few hours later, when Rafferty vanished, Wilcox and his fellow troopers knew the car was worse than dangerous -- and that it would be better if John Q. Public never found out about it. Curt's avid curiosity taking the lead, they investigated as best they could, as much as they dared. Over the years the troop absorbed the mystery as part of the background to their work, the Buick 8 sitting out there like a still life painting that breathes -- inhaling a little bit of this world, exhaling a little bit of whatever world it came from. In the fall of 2001, a few months after Curt Wilcox is killed in a gruesome auto accident, his 18-year-old boy Ned starts coming by the barracks, mowing the lawn, washing windows, shoveling snow. Sandy Dearborn, Sergeant Commanding, knows it's the boy's way of holding onto his father, and Ned is allowed to become part of the Troop D family. One day he looks in the window of Shed B and discovers the family secret. Like his father, Ned wants answers, and the secret begins to stir, not only in the minds and hearts of the veteran troopers who surround him, but in Shed B as well.","subjects":{"1":["Abandonment of automobiles","Fiction."],"2":["Police","Pennsylvania","Fiction."],"3":["Buick automobile","Fiction."],"4":["Teenage boys","Fiction."],"5":["Pennsylvania-Fiction."],"6":["Buick automobile-Fiction."],"7":["Police-Pennsylvania-fiction."],"8":["Teenage boys-Fiction."],"9":["Abandonment of automobiles-Fiction."]}},

The Golden City of the Bells, where only humans live, is ruled by the Mage Council, practitioners of High Magic---a powerful magic that is stable and reliable, though rigidly controlled and performed only by men. Outside the City's walls, humans and magical beings mix freely and call upon Wild Magic---a system sometimes erratic, always driven by desire and need, and performed by both men and women. Now, in To Light a Candle, the Demon Queen sends her forces against her human and elven enemies, sowing distraction and death. In the human City, the Queen's agents work to divide the Council and foment rebellion among the City's citizens. In the countryside, they target the most vulnerable and valuable---the young Elf Prince and the Wild Mages who might be the Demons' most dangerous enemies. To his own surprise, young Kellen, once the disappointing son of the great Mage who leads the City's Mage Council, has become a powerful Knight-Mage. Valued for his bravery and his skills as both wizard and warrior, Kellen joins the Elves' war councils. Yet he cannot convince the City of his birth that it is in terrible danger. Kellen's sister Idalia, a Wild Mage with great healing ability, has pledged her heart to Jermayan, a proud Elven warrior. Someday Idalia will pay a tragic Price for a world-saving work of Wild Magic, but until then, she will claim any joy life can offer her. Jermayan, who has learned much while fighting at Kellen's side and loving the human Idalia, finds that everything changes when he Bonds with a dragon while rescuing the Elf Prince and becomes the first Elven Mage in a thousand years. Furious at her enemies' success with the dragon, the Demon Queen attacks in force.

  {"isbn":"0312331754","author":"Lustbader, Eric","title":"Robert Ludlum's Jason Bourne in The Bourne legacy: a novel","summary":"In Robert Ludlum's ground-breaking career, no other character so captured and held the world's imagination as Jason Bourne. He appeared in three of Robert Ludlum's own #1 bestselling novels - The Bourne Identity, The Bourne Supremacy, and The Bourne Ultimatum - and they remain amongst Ludlum's most-read and most-loved books to this day. Now, for the first time ever, the Estate of Robert Ludlum has acceded to the demands of readers around the world, turning to bestselling author Eric Van Lustbader to bring Jason Bourne back to life in a thrilling new novel. Jason Bourne is known and feared in the deadly world of covert-ops as one of the most highly skilled assassins for hire. Bourne, however, was merely an identity assumed by CIA agent David Webb, a personality implanted by the CIA to facilitate a dangerous operation, but one that threatened to subsume David Webb entirely. Years after the events of The Bourne Identity, Webb is no longer an active CIA agent and is now a professor of Eastern Studies at Georgetown University, living a quiet life, far from the dangers of his previous life. Until one day he finds himself the target of an assassin nearly as skilled as himself and is framed for the brutal murder of his two closest associates and friends. Fighting for his life against unseen assailants, as well as the full resources of the CIA who believe he has gone dangerously rogue, the Bourne identity asserts itself, leaving Jason Bourne in control. Now Bourne must use all his skills to stay alive as he battles against a determined assassin, the combined skills of the world's intelligence networks, and a shadowy figure in the background, skillfully manipulating events and people, in a far deadlier and more dangerous game than any of them realize.","subjects":{"1":["Bourne, Jason (Fictitious character)","Fiction."],"2":["Attempted assassination","Fiction."],"3":["Intelligence officers","Fiction."],"4":["Undercover operations","Fiction."],"5":["College teachers","Fiction."],"6":["Assassins","Fiction."],"7":["Crime","Mystery","Fiction."]}},

Robb Stark's demise has broken the back of the Northern rebels, and his siblings are scattered throughout the kingdom like seeds on barren soil. Few legitimate claims to the once desperately sought Iron Throne still exist--or they are held in hands too weak or too distant to wield them effectively.

The woman is Sethe, and the novel traces her journey from slavery to freedom during and immediately following the Civil War. Woven into this circular, mesmerizing narrative are the horrible truths of Sethe's past: the incredible cruelties she endured as a slave, and the hardships she suffered in her journey north to freedom. Just as Sethe finds the past too painful to remember, and the future just \"a matter of keeping the past at bay,\" her story is almost too painful to read. Yet Morrison manages to imbue the wreckage of her characters' lives with compassion, humanity, and humor. Part ghost story, part history lesson, part folk tale, Beloved finds beauty in the unbearable, and lets us all see the enduring promise of hope that lies in anyones future.","subjects":{"1":["African American women","Fiction."],"2":["Women slaves","Fiction."],"3":["Infanticide","Fiction."],"4":["Slavery","Fiction.","Ohio.","sears"]}},

At the same time, she inadvertently becomes involved in the story of a missing Egyptian boy whose possible terrorist connections make him very much sought after by the government. As the two cases drive her forward-and then shockingly tumble together-she finds that wealth and privilege, too, bear a terrible price; and the past has no monopoly on patriotic scoundrels. Before everything is over, at least two more people will lie dead . . . and V.I. might even be one of them.

Her first work of nonfiction in more than twenty years, this book is the story of designing and constructing that house, with its solar panels, Japanese soak tub, concrete floor and elk horn handles on kitchen cabinets. It is also an enthralling natural history and archaeology of the region, inhabited for millennia by Ute, Arapaho and Shoshone Indians, and a family history, going back to nineteenth century Mississippi riverboat captains and Canadian settlers. The author here turns her lens on herself. We understand how she came to be living in a house surrounded by wilderness, with shelves for thousands of books and long worktables on which to heap manuscripts, research materials and maps, and how she came to be one of the great American writers of her time.","subjects":{"1":["Women authors, American","Biography."],"2":["Natural history","Wyoming."],"3":["Women authors","Biography.","sears"],"4":["American authors","Biography.","sears"],"5":["Naturbeobachtung.","swd"]}},

  {"isbn":"0385336349","author":"Steel, Danielle","title":"Echoes","summary":"Against a vivid backdrop of history, Danielle Steel tells a compelling story of love and war, acts of faith and acts of betrayal...and of three generations of women as they journey though years of loss and survival, linked by an indomitable devotion that echoes across time. For the Wittgenstein family, the summer of 1915 was a time of both prosperity and unease, as the guns of war sound in the distance. But for eldest daughter Beata, it was also a summer of awakening. By the glimmering waters of Lake Geneva, the quiet Jewish beauty met a young French officer and fell in love. Knowing that her parents would never accept her marriage to a Catholic, Beata followed her heart anyway. And as the two built a new life together, Beata's past would stay with her in ways she could never have predicted. For as the years pass, and Europe is once again engulfed in war, Beata must watch in horror as Hitler's terror threatens her life and family-even her eighteen-year-old daughter Amadea, who has taken on the vows of a Carmelite nun. For Amadea, the convent is no refuge. As family and friends are swept away without a trace, Amadea is forced into hiding. Thus begins a harrowing journey of survival, as she escapes into the heart of the French Resistance. Here Amadea will find a renewed sense of purpose, taking on the most daring missions behind enemy lines. And it is here, in the darkest moments of fear, that Amadea will feel her mother's loving strength-and that of her mother's mother before her-as the voices of lost loved ones echo powerfully in her heart. And here, amid the fires of war, Amadea will meet an extraordinary man, British secret agent Rupert Montgomery. In Colonel Montgomery, Amadea finds a man who will help her discover her place in an unbreakable chain between generations...and between her lost family and her dreams for the future-a future she is only just beginning to imagine: a future of hope rooted in the rich soil of the past. With the grace of a master storyteller, Danielle Steel breathes life into history, creating a bold, sweeping tale filled with unforgettable characters and breathtaking images-from the elegant rituals of Europe's prewar aristocracy to the brutal desperation of Germany's death camps. Drawing us into a vanished world, Echoes weaves an intricate tapestry of a mother's love, a daughter's courage...and the unwavering faith that sustained them-even in history's darkest hour.","subjects":{"1":["World War, 1939-1945","Underground movements","Fiction."],"2":["Christian converts from Judaism","Fiction."],"3":["World War, 1939-1945","Women","Fiction."],"4":["Concentration camp inmates","Fiction."],"5":["Concentration camp escapes","Fiction."],"6":["Mothers and daughters","Fiction."],"7":["Women","Europe","Fiction."],"8":["Catholics","Fiction."],"9":["Nuns","Fiction."],"10":["War stories.","gsafd"]}},

The place-a small, entirely corrupt Midwestern burg named Locke City, currently owned top to bottom by homegrown Royal Beaumont. Crippled by a childhood disease, Royal rules from a wheelchair-throne; few, though, have ever doubted that his power is absolute. Or not until now, when rival mobs-one Irish, one Italian-suddenly sense windows of opportunity. They lurk at Locke City's perimeter and sniff around Royal's honey-pots-prostitution, gambling, protection-in a way calculated to cause maximum anxiety. In response, Royal sends for outside help in the form of Walker Dett, a man with the sort of \"stillness\" to him. Dett is a killer, a hired gun with the war smarts of a Clausewitz. There's plot and counterplot as hard guys maneuver for position and form unlikely alliances. Dett, however, is always in charge, a dodge ahead of his enemies. He schemes, lures and, when at last he pounces, few are left standing. But Dett has a softer side and it catches him unaware. One night, the Angel of Death meets an Earth Angel and, to his astonishment, he falls in love. Life altering for Dett; for the reader unexpectedly moving.

Following the triumphant success of her Kushiel series (Kushiel's Dart, Kushiel's Chosen, Kushiel's Avatar), Jacqueline Carey now turns her hand to another startling fable, an epic tale of gods waging war in their bid to control an entire universe and the mortals they use as chess pieces in a most deadly game. Once, the Seven Shapers dwelled in accord. First born among them was Haomane, Lord-of-Thought and with his brother and sister gods, the seven drew upon of the power of the Souma, claimed a race of beings for their own and began Shaping the world to their will. But Haomane saw the ways of this new world and was displeased. For in his younger brother Satoris, once called the Sower, Haomane thought too prideful and in his gift, the quickening of the flesh too freely to the races and to that of Man in particular. Haomane asked Satoris to withdraw his gift from men but he refused, and so began the Shapers' War. Eons have passed. The war that ensued sundered the very world. Haomane and his siblings lay to one end of a vast ocean unable to touch their creations, Satoris and the races of the world on the other. Satoris has been broken and left adrift among the peoples of the world and is reviled, with most of the races believing that it was he alone who caused the rift and depriving them of the balm of the seven. He sits in Darkhaven, controlling his own dominion seeking not victory but neither vengeance. But still Haomane is not content. Through Haomane's whispers in the minds and hearts of the races of the world come a prophecy that if Satoris were defeated, the world could be made whole and all would bask in the light of the Souma again. And the few who stay by Satoris are viewed as the ultimate evil, and so the races come together to defeat Satoris, a being who helped engender them all but who is caught in his elder brother's warp.

During the construction of the house, a powerful attraction developed between Mamah and Frank, and in time the lovers, each married with children, embarked on a course that would shock Chicago society and forever change their lives. In this ambitious debut novel, fact and fiction blend together brilliantly. While scholars have largely relegated Mamah to a footnote in the life of America's greatest architect, author Nancy Horan gives full weight to their dramatic love story and illuminates Cheney's profound influence on Wright. Drawing on years of research, Horan weaves little-known facts into a compelling narrative, vividly portraying the conflicts and struggles of a woman forced to choose between the roles of mother, wife, lover, and intellectual. Horan's Mamah is a woman seeking to find her own place, her own creative calling in the world. Mamah's is an unforgettable journey marked by choices that reshape her notions of love and responsibility, leading inexorably ultimately lead to this novel's stunning conclusion.","subjects":{"1":["Architects","Fiction."]}},

A Thousand Splendid Suns is a breathtaking story set against the volatile events of Afghanistan's last thirty years-from the Soviet invasion to the reign of the Taliban to post-Taliban rebuilding-that puts the violence, fear, hope and faith of this country in intimate, human terms. It is a tale of two generations of characters brought jarringly together by the tragic sweep of war, where personal lives-the struggle to survive, raise a family, find happiness-are inextricable from the history playing out around them. Propelled by the same storytelling instinct that made The Kite Runner a beloved classic, A Thousand Splendid Suns is at once a remarkable chronicle of three decades of Afghan history and a deeply moving account of family and friendship. It is a striking, heart wrenching novel of an unforgiving time, an unlikely friendship, and an indestructible love-a stunning accomplishment.","subjects":{"1":["Families","Fiction."],"2":["Loss (Psychology)","Fiction."],"3":["Intergenerational relations","Fiction."],"4":["Family sagas","Fiction."]}},

He was not only involved in the struggle against intolerance, he was obsessed with it\" are the words used to describe the now world famous author Stieg Larsson by his friend and close colleague, Kurdo Baksi, who himself was a prominent character in The Millennium Trilogy. During Larsson's career as a journalist he was a crucial figure in the battle against racism and for democracy in Sweden as one of the founders of the anti fascist magazine Expo. The author first met Larsson in 1992, triggering an intense friendship and a fruitful, but challenging, working relationship.  In this candid memoir, the author answers the questions a multitude of Larsson's fans have already asked about his childhood, the recurring death threats, his insomnia, his vices, and his feminism, so evident in his books, as well as his own personal dogma.

To that end, Bill Bryson apprenticed himself to a host of the world's most profound scientific minds, living and dead. His challenge is to take subjects like geology, chemistry, paleontology, astronomy, and particle physics and see if there isn't some way to render them comprehensible to people, like himself, made bored (or scared) stiff of science by school. His interest is not simply to discover what we know but to find out how we know it. How do we know what is in the center of the earth, thousands of miles beneath the surface? How can we know the extent and the composition of the universe, or what a black hole is? How can we know where the continents were 600 million years ago? How did anyone ever figure these things out? On his travels through space and time, Bill Bryson encounters a splendid gallery of the most fascinating, eccentric, competitive, and foolish personalities ever to ask a hard question. In their company, he undertakes a sometimes profound, sometimes funny, and always supremely clear and entertaining adventure in the realms of human knowledge.","subjects":{"1":["Science","Popular works."]}},

Noted skeptic Massimo Pigliucci sets out to separate the fact from the fantasy in this entertaining exploration of the nature of science, the borderlands of fringe science, and--borrowing a famous phrase from philosopher Jeremy Bentham--the nonsense on stilts. Covering a range of controversial topics, Pigliucci cuts through the ambiguity surrounding science to look more closely at how science is conducted, how it is disseminated, how it is interpreted, and what it means to our society. The result is in many ways a \"taxonomy of bunk\" that explores the intersection of science and culture at large\"--Publisher description.","subjects":{"1":["Pseudoscience","History."],"2":["Science","History."],"3":["Pseudowissenschaft.","idszbz"]}},

  {"isbn":"9781451648539","author":"Isaacson, Walter","title":"Steve Jobs","summary":"This is the exclusive biography of Steve Jobs. Based on more than forty interviews with Jobs conducted over two years, as well as interviews with more than a hundred family members, friends, adversaries, competitors, and colleagues the author has written a riveting story of the roller-coaster life and searingly intense personality of a creative entrepreneur whose passion for perfection and ferocious drive revolutionized six industries: personal computers, animated movies, music, phones, tablet computing, and digital publishing. At a time when America is seeking ways to sustain its innovative edge, and when societies around the world are trying to build digital-age economies, Jobs stands as the ultimate icon of inventiveness and applied imagination. He knew that the best way to create value in the twenty-first century was to connect creativity with technology. He built a company where leaps of the imagination were combined with remarkable feats of engineering. Although Jobs cooperated with this book, he asked for no control over what was written nor even the right to read it before it was published. He put nothing off-limits. He encouraged the people he knew to speak honestly. And Jobs speaks candidly, sometimes brutally so, about the people he worked with and competed against. His friends, foes, and colleagues provide an unvarnished view of the passions, perfectionism, obsessions, artistry, devilry, and compulsion for control that shaped his approach to business and the innovative products that resulted. Driven by demons, Jobs could drive those around him to fury and despair. But his personality and products were interrelated, just as Apple's hardware and software tended to be, as if part of an integrated system. His tale is instructive and cautionary, filled with lessons about innovation, character, leadership, and values.","subjects":{"1":["Computer engineers","United States","Biography."],"2":["Businesspeople","United States","Biography."],"3":["BIOGRAPHY & AUTOBIOGRAPHY / Business.","bisacsh"],"4":["BUSINESS & ECONOMICS / General.","bisacsh"],"5":["TECHNOLOGY & ENGINEERING / General.","bisacsh"],"6":["Businessmen","United States","Biography.","sears"],"7":["Computer industry","United States","Biography.","sears"],"8":["Computer engineers","United States","Biography."],"9":["Businesspeople","United States","Biography."]}},

Is it possible for the human body to survive a bailout at 17,000 miles per hour? To answer these questions, space agencies set up all manner of quizzical and startlingly bizarre space simulations.

Dr. David Kessler, the dynamic former FDA commissioner who reinvented the food label and tackled the tobacco industry, now cracks the code of overeating by explaining how our bodies and minds are changed when we consume foods that contain sugar, fat, and salt. Food manufacturers create products by manipulating these ingredients to stimulate our appetites, setting in motion a cycle of desire and consumption that ends with a nation of overeaters.

The emergence of strange new diseases is a frightening problem that seems to be getting worse. In this age of speedy travel, it threatens a worldwide pandemic. We hear news reports of Ebola, SARS, AIDS, and something called Hendra killing horses and people in Australia; but those reports miss the big truth that such phenomena are part of a single pattern. The bugs that transmit these diseases share one thing: they originate in wild animals and pass to humans by a process called spillover.  As globalization spreads and as we destroy the ancient ecosystems, penetrating ever deeper into the furthest reaches of the planet, we encounter strange and dangerous infections that originate in animals but can be transmitted to humans. It is reckoned that at least 60% of our infections diseases derive from animals. Diseases that were contained are being set free and the results are potentially catastrophic. The author tracks this subject around the world. He recounts adventures in the field, netting bats in China, trapping monkeys in Bangladesh, stalking gorillas in the Congo, with the world's leading disease scientists. He takes the reader along on this quest to learn how, where from, and why these diseases emerge, and he asks the terrifying question: What might the next big one be?","subjects":{"1":["Animals as carriers of disease."],"2":["Zoonoses","etiology","Popular Works."],"3":["Communicable Diseases, Emerging","etiology","Popular Works."],"4":["Pandemics","Popular Works."],"5":["Zoönosen.","gtt"],"6":["Virussen (biologie)","gtt"],"7":["Animals as carriers of disease.","fast","(OCoLC)fst00809570"]}},

No one else writing on fat America takes as hard a line as Critser on the institutionalized lies we've been telling ourselves about how much we can eat and how little we can exercise. His expose of the Los Angeles schools' opening of the nutritional floodgates in the lunchroom and his examination of the political and cultural forces that have set the bar on American fitness low and then lower, are both discerning reporting and impassioned wake-up calls. Disarmingly funny, Fat land leaves no diet book - including Dr. Atkins's - unturned. Fashions, both leisure and street, and American-style religion are subject to Critser's gimlet eye as well. Memorably, Fat land takes on baby-boomer parenting shibboleths - that young children won't eat past the point of being full and that the dinner table isn't the place to talk about food rules - and gives advice many families will use to lose. Critser's futuristic portrait of a Fat America just around the corner and his all too contemporary foray into the diabetes ward of a major children's hospital make Fat land a chilling but brilliantly rendered portrait of the cost in human lives - many of them very young lives - of America's obesity epidemic.","subjects":{"1":["Obesity","United States."],"2":["Obesity","United States."],"3":["Vetzucht.","gtt"],"4":["Eetgewoonten.","gtt"],"5":["Obésité","États-Unis."],"6":["Übergewicht.","swd"],"7":["Ernährungsgewohnheit.","swd"],"8":["Obésité","États-Unis.","ram"],"9":["Obesity.","fast","(OCoLC)fst01042738"]}},

  {"isbn":"9781592402687","author":"Fainaru-Wada, Mark","title":"Game of shadows: Barry Bonds, BALCO, and the steroids scandal that rocked professional sports","summary":"The complete inside story of the shocking steroids scandal that made headlines across the country - told by the award-winning reporters who broke the story and featuring major new revelations about high-profile athletes. For years, in the shadowy reaches of the world of sport, there were rumors that some of our nation's greatest athletes were using steroids, human growth hormone, and other drugs to run faster, jump higher, and hit harder. But as track stars like Marion Jones blazed their way to Olympic medals and sluggers such as Mark McGwire brought fans back to baseball with stratospheric home runs, sports officials, the media, and fans looked past the rumors and cheered on the stars to ever-higher levels of performance. Then, in December 2004, after more than fifteen months of relentless reporting, San Francisco Chronicle reporters Mark Fainaru-Wada and Lance Williams broke the story of the Bay Area Lab Co-operative, a tiny nutritional supplement company that according to sworn testimony was supplying elite athletes, including baseball MVP Jason Giambi, with banned drugs. The stories, exposing rampant cheating at the highest levels of athletics, shocked the nation as sports heroes were brought low and their records were tainted. The exposes led to Congressional hearings on baseball's drug problems, and a revived effort to purge the U.S. Olympic movement of drug cheats. Now, in Game of Shadows, Fainaru-Wada and Williams tell the complete story of BALCO and the investigation that has shaken the foundations of the sporting world. They reveal how an obscure, self-proclaimed nutritionist, Victor Conte, became a steroid svengali to multi-millionaire athletes desperate for a competitive edge, and how he created superstars with his potent cocktails of miracle drugs. They expose the international web of coaches and trainers who funneled athletes to BALCO, and how the drug cheats stayed a step ahead of the testing agencies and the law. They detail how an aggressive IRS investigator doggedly gathered evidence until Conte and his co-conspirators were brought to justice. And at the center of the story is the biggest star of them all, Barry Bonds, the muscle-bound MVP outfielder of the San Francisco Giants whose suspicious late-career renaissance has him threatening Hank Aaron's all-time home run record. Shocking, revelatory, and page-turning, Game of Shadows casts light into the shadows of American sport to reveal the dark truths at the heart of the game today.","subjects":{"1":["Anabolic steroids","Health aspects."],"2":["Doping in sports."],"3":["Steroids."]}},

Now, in 2010, eleven BP workers were killed in the Gulf of Mexico's Macondo blowout. What's next? In In Too Deep : BP and the Drilling Race that Took It Down, Stanley Reed--a journalist who has covered BP for over a decade--and investigative reporter Alison Fitzgerald answer not only the question of what's next but also examine why these disasters always happen to BP and not to the other large oil companies. The book shows that practices put in place by former BP CEO John Browne who was forced to resign after salacious details of his private life emerged in 2007 may have more to do with the disaster than anything The book also details a BP built on risk-taking and cost-cutting and examines the past, present, and future of BP. In August 2010, BP successfully \"killed\" the company's damaged deepwater well. But, the environmental fallout and public relations campaign to rebuild the brand are just beginning.

The biggest earthquake in Japan's history-and one of the world's five most powerful since 1900-devastated the Tohoku region, 320 kilometers (200 miles) northeast of Tokyo.  It triggered a huge tsunami that left crippling damage in its wake.  More than 13,000 people drowned, and thousands of buildings and homes were reduced to rubble.  As people assessed the damage, they made the most frightening discovery of all:  the Fukushima #1 nuclear power plant was seriously damaged and three of its six reactors were heading for meltdowns.  Workers tried desperately-but unsuccessfully-to save them.  Explosions and fires released radioactivity into the air.  Within days the Japanese government declared a 20-kilometer (12-mile) evacuation zone.  The future of the plant, the long-term health of those exposed to radiation, and the effects on the environment remained uncertain.  Learn more about this massive catastrophe as Dr. Fred Bortz examines both the human tragedy and the scientific implications of the nuclear meltdown.  Compare this disaster to similar nuclear events in the United States and in Ukraine, and move ahead with Dr. Bortz as he explores the global debate about the future of nuclear power and alternative sources of energy.","subjects":{"1":["Nuclear power plants","Accidents","Japan","Fukushima-ken","Juvenile literature."],"2":["Nuclear reactor accidents","Japan","Fukushima-ken","Juvenile literature."],"3":["Boiling water reactors","Accidents","Japan","Fukushima-ken","Juvenile literature."],"4":["Nuclear energy","Safety measures","Juvenile literature."],"5":["Tsunami damage","Japan","Fukushima-ken","Juvenile literature."],"6":["Nuclear power plants","Accidents","Japan","Fukushima-ken."],"7":["Nuclear reactor accidents","Japan","Fukushima-ken."],"8":["Boiling water reactors","Accidents","Japan","Fukushima-ken."],"9":["Nuclear energy","Safety measures."],"10":["Tsunami damage","Japan","Fukushima-ken."],"11":["Nuclear power plants","Accidents","Fukushima-ken (Japan)","sears"],"12":["Nuclear reactors","Accidents","Fukushima-ken (Japan)","sears"],"13":["Nuclear energy","Safety measures.","sears"],"14":["Tsunamis","Fukushima-ken (Japan)","sears"]}},

It is this, the inner world of the early astronauts, John Glenn, Alan Shepard, Gus Grissom, and their confreres, that Tom Wolfe describes with his extraordinary powers of empathy. He shows us the bidden olympus to which all ambitious combat and test pilots aspired, the top of the pyramid of the right stuff. And we learn the nature of the ineffable pilot's grace without which all else meant nothing. We see the men whose achievements dominated the flying fraternity in the late 1950's as the space age began, men like Chuck Yeager and Joe Walker, pilots of the first rocket planes, most notably the X-1 and the X-15. The selection of the Mercury astronauts in 1959 shook up the fraternity as thoroughly as had Yeager's breaking of the sound barrier twelve years before. Public excitement and concern over the space race with the Soviets immediately elevated the seven astronauts to the uneasy eminence of heroes, long before their first flight. We see the seven men, in the very moment of their idolization by the outside world, struggling to gain the respect of their peers within the flying fraternity, even to the point of altering NASA's original conception of the astronaut's role in keeping with the unspoken prerequisites of the right stuff. - Author web site.","subjects":{"1":["Astronautics","United States."],"2":["Astronauts","United States."],"3":["Ruimtevaart.","gtt"],"4":["Astronautics.","fast","(OCoLC)fst00819505"],"5":["Astronauts.","fast","(OCoLC)fst00819615"]}},
  {"isbn":"9781451625349","author":"Achenbach, Joel","title":"A hole at the bottom of the sea: the race to kill the BP oil gusher","summary":"It was a technological crisis in an alien realm: a blown-out oil well in mile-deep water in the Gulf of Mexico. For the engineers who had to kill the well, this was like Apollo 13, a crisis no one saw coming, and one of untold danger and challenge. A suspense story, a mystery, a technological thriller: This is the author's account of the Deepwater Horizon disaster and what came after. The tragic explosion on the huge drilling rig in April 2010 killed eleven men and triggered an environmental disaster. As a gusher of crude surged into the Gulf's waters, BP engineers and government scientists, awkwardly teamed in Houston, raced to devise ways to plug the Macondo well. The author moves beyond the blame game to tell the gripping story of what it was like, behind the scenes, moment by moment, in the struggle to kill Macondo. Here are the controversies, the miscalculations, the frustrations, and ultimately the technical triumphs of men and women who worked out of sight and around the clock for months to find a way to plug the well. The Deepwater Horizon disaster was an environmental 9/11. The government did not have the means to solve the problem; only the private sector had the tools, and it didn't have the right ones as the country became haunted by Macondo's black plume, which was omnipresent on TV and the Internet. Remotely operated vehicles, the spaceships of the deep, had to perform the challenging technical maneuvers on the seafloor. Engineers choreographed this robotic ballet and crammed years of innovation into a single summer. As he describes the drama in Houston, the author probes the government investigation into what went wrong in the deep sea. This was a confounding mystery, an engineering whodunit. The lessons of this tragedy can be applied broadly to all complex enterprises and should make us look more closely at the highly engineered society that surrounds us. This is a cautionary tale that doubles as a technological thriller. -- Provided by publisher.","subjects":{"1":["Offshore oil well drilling","Technological innovations."],"2":["Oil well cementing."],"3":["Technology and state","United States."],"4":["BP Deepwater Horizon Explosion and Oil Spill, 2010."],"5":["Offshore oil well drilling","Political aspects","United States."],"6":["HISTORY","General.","bisacsh"],"7":["SCIENCE","General.","bisacsh"],"8":["TECHNOLOGY & ENGINEERING","General.","bisacsh"],"9":["BP Deepwater Horizon Explosion and Oil Spill, 2010.","sears"],"10":["Offshore oil well drilling","Political aspects.","sears"],"11":["Technology and civilization","United States.","sears"],"12":["Offshore oil well drilling","Technological innovations.","sears"]}},

  {"isbn":"9780670026234","author":"London, Stacy","title":"The truth about style","summary":"\"The hilarious, beloved cohost of TLC's What Not to Wear examines the universal obstacles all women--including herself--put in their way With her unique talent for seeing past disastrous wardrobes to the core emotional issues that caused these sartorial crises, style savant Stacy London has transformed not only the looks but also the lives of hundreds of guests who have appeared on What Not to Wear. Now for the first time in print, London turns that expert X-ray insight on herself. Like the women she's transformed, London has plenty of emotional baggage. At eleven, she suffered from severe psoriasis that left her with permanent physical and mental scars. During college, she became anorexic on a misguided quest for perfection. By the time she joined the staff at Vogue, London's weight had doubled from binge eating. Although self-esteem and self-consciousness nearly sabotaged a promising career, London learned the hard way that we wear our insecurities every day. It wasn't until she found the self-confidence to develop a strong personal style that she finally became comfortable in her skin. In The Truth About Style, London shares her own often painful history and her philosophy of the healing power of personal style--illustrating it with a series of detailed \"start-overs\" with eight real women, demonstrating how personal style helps them overcome the emotional obstacles we all face. For anyone who has ever despaired of finding the right clothes, or even taking an objective assessment in a full-length mirror, The Truth About Style will be an inspiring, liberating, and often very funny guide to finding the expression of your truest self. \"--","subjects":{"1":["Fashion","Psychological aspects."],"2":["Personality."],"3":["Self-esteem."],"4":["Expression (Philosophy)"],"5":["SELF-HELP / Personal Growth / Happiness.","bisacsh"],"6":["DESIGN / Fashion.","bisacsh"],"7":["BIOGRAPHY & AUTOBIOGRAPHY / Personal Memoirs.","bisacsh"],"8":["Expression (Philosophy)","fast","(OCoLC)fst00918886"],"9":["Fashion","Psychological aspects.","fast","(OCoLC)fst00921618"],"10":["Personality.","fast","(OCoLC)fst01058667"],"11":["Self-esteem.","fast","(OCoLC)fst01111662"]}},
